Try to answer a riddle by Shane.

##Question 1
What is the least number (N) of unique prime number valued coins required to achieve any sum between 2 and 100 using X coins where X is as few coins as possible.

So for example - with enough 2cent and 3cent coins you can achieve this but that would take a lot of coins. As it would take 34 coins to make 100 (3*32+2*2).

##Question 2
Assuming N = 5 what five prime numbers would you use to achieve any number between 2-100 in the least amount of moves. [edit - I say moves but I mean least amount of coins]

###Question 2A
What number[2-100] takes the most coins to reach.

###Question 3
Solve for N=X
